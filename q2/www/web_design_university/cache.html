    Browser cache, which is similar to cookies, cache is temporary storage of web documents, like web pages, images etc to reduce server lag.
    When clearing cookies and cache, you are removing the data of the page that is stored on your web browser. When you first go on the website
    with the popup, it sees that it is your first time on the site so the popup pushes onto your screen. Whereas if you nagatived to the site
    again, the cache does not allow the popup to show. So, clearing the data would enable the popup to work again.
